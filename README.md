### Code Snippet

```
 <div class="container p-10">
    <div class="row time-block">
      <span class="col-md-1 hour">9 AM</span>
      <textarea id="t1" class="col-md-10 description">
      </textarea>
      <button id="b1" class="saveBtn col-md-1 bg-success"><i class="fas fa-save"></i></button>
    </div>
```
{: .language-ruby}

#### Code snippet showing how the rows were created in html using bootstrap.

```
var saveBtn2 = $("#b2")
var text2 = $("#t2")

saveBtn2.on("click", function () {
    var note2 = text2.val();
    localStorage.setItem("10", note2);
})

function retain2() {
    var maintain = localStorage.getItem("10");
    text2.text(maintain)
}
retain2()
```
{: .language-ruby}

#### Code snippet of variables referenced with jquery selectors on the html. There is an event listener on that specific row's save button, which on click will save the contents of the text area to local storage. Then there is a persist function which will display your previously entered text even upon a page reload.
